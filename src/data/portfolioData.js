            summary: "A digital platform built to simplify the rental process for Nigerians by eliminating fraud, unnecessary agent fees, and scattered information—empowering both tenants and landlords to connect directly and securely.",
            project: "The RentWise project began with one goal: to solve the stress of home renting in Nigeria. Inspired by Chinedu's real-world struggles, the platform was designed to provide verified listings, remove reliance on agents, and support landlords through a tech-light onboarding process.",
            problem: `In the heart of Lagos, renting a home is often more stressful than it should be. Chinedu, a 29-year-old civil engineer, thought he was prepared for the apartment hunt. But what he encountered was a maze of fake listings, hidden charges, and unresponsive agents. Each new lead came with uncertainty—and unexpected costs like agency and legal fees that pushed the price far beyond his budget.\nChinedu’s story is far too common. For many tenants in Lagos, the rental process is overwhelming and emotionally draining. Information is scattered, communication is slow, and the involvement of multiple intermediaries only adds to the confusion and cost. What should be a straightforward search for a home becomes a frustrating, time-consuming ordeal.\nThe current system fails renters. It lacks transparency, efficiency, and trust. What’s urgently needed is a digital-first, user-friendly solution that simplifies the rental journey—cutting through the noise, reducing costs, and helping people like Chinedu find a home without the stress.`,
