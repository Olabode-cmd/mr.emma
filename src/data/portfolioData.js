The System Usability Scale (SUS) score averaged 88/100, reflecting high satisfaction and ease of use. Drop-off rate decreased by 40% after design refinements, while task confidence increased by 60%, particularly during filtering and application flows.\n\nParticipants praised the clean layout, verified listings, and scam-free experience. These results confirm RentWise as a fast, reliable, and user-friendly platform tailored to the real needs of Nigerian renters.`,
